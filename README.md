# Open Letter to Comcast / SpinCo, owners of NBC Universal

#### Please end the Mallik Mental Health Minstrel Show once and for all, this country has suffered enough

## A Preamble / Hopeful Conclusion

To the CEO and the boards, while this is your decision to make, I'd like to emphasize my feeling that it is not your fault.

For those whose fault this is, wherever they may exist within your org charts, they executed poorly based on two possible opportunities which are no longer present.

One opportunity was to make a reality show around my family and I; however this would involve me providing my consent, and I will do no such thing for no price whatsoever: the opportunity to make a TV show is not happening.

The other opportunity was around coordinating a legal issue which has since ended at least a week and a half ago, and the business development opportunities such a coordination could provide to Comcast and it's organizations given the "A-Z list" of celebrities whom took an interest in the issue. However, given the rocky road the legal issue took, along with my own interjections, it's dubious at best to say the business development opportunities still exist in full, and among those that do, allowing this situation to continue is not helping as it casts doubts on the efficacy of those engaging in the situation for business development purposes.

There is only one thing that continuing this situation is allowing: an attempt for those who have failed you, whose fault this is, to save some face, which they will not be able to do, because the continuation of this situation will only force me to speak outwardly about it, which is damaging to them, but unfortunately also to the organizations whom trusted them.

Think: a week ago, many knew the legal situation had ended, but I wasn't saying anything - many likely presumed that was a good sign as towards this situation ending the harm it has caused, and most looked well on this. Now those that would look well on this ending it's harm cannot do so as they are aware the situation, and thus the harm it causes, persists.

So I'd ask you this: given that this situation bears no opportunity to make a product or aide in business expansion, is it worth it to let those whose fault it is attempt to save their own reputation at the cost of the company given the negative internal media PR and damage control that has already cost so much in expensive labor hours that could have gone to areas of the business that actually make products or lasting strategic connections, all while this effort is making no product and only challenging the strength of strategic connections by forcing others to question the purpose, trustfullness, and efficacy of those they partner with? Is this still good for the _business_?

Currently those under you are trying and failing to convince me the legal issue continues, likely to buy time to figure out what to _actually_ do to end this situation in their favor, which is a pipe dream at this point considering all that has and hasn't happened.
 
Given there's no product or strategic connection to be maintained in this situation, is it worth the cost of continuing it?

Woudln't it be easier to control the story as a positive tool for business communications - who doesn't love a good story? - without me having a need to write further into it? Wouldn't that be easier if the story ended? It would for me. And I think it would be easiest for the board to deal with this before and not after Q4 meetings wrap up.

Thank you for your time; more to come here as and if needed.

## The Central Legal Challenge
#### 11/20/2024
#### _cc: CEO Brian Roberts, CLO Thomas Reid, EVPs and General Counsels Lynn Charytan, Francis Buono, Kimberly Harris, and the rest of the boards at Comcast, SpinCo, and NBC_

To the legal officials representing Comcast / SpinCo, I'd like to again reiterate that though this may be your responsibility, it is not necessarily your fault.

Many illegal and legally gray offenses were committed against my name and with no consent or contracts signed to allow this from myself over the course of the past two plus years that were either conducted within the organizations under Comcast / SpinCo, or with collusion by Comcast / SpinCo representatives.

The worst of the offenses may be colluding to commit, coordinate, and conceal criminal medical malpractice, in an affront to medical ethics established via the Tuskegee Experiments, the Nuremberg Trials, and more. Other offenses would fall under the filming and livestreaming of myself to audiences without and against my consent.

Those allowing these acts to take place under Comcast / SpinCo's ownership felt that all legal claims would be suppressed after and not before the fact by my signing a contract to agree to a reality television show, and acted with brazen criminality as a result: for this, they were greatly mistaken. I will never, ever sign a contract withdrawing legal claims and allowing harm to be conducted against me in exchange for a reality television show I never agreed to be a part of and would never agree to. I do not wish to be famous.

Comcast / SpinCo could choose to simply walk away from the situation and deny it ever happened, but that would create a negative atmosphere amongst the media in many forms detrimental to Comcast / SpinCo's overall goals as a media organization. The largest complication is that all of this occured with most of the media watching via the non consensual filming of me being live streamed by Comcast / SpinCo representatives, where many were under the assumption that such an act was sympathethic and agreeable to me: it was and is not.

Within the media, many on the creative side took it as a rubric of inspiration and created popular media products in light of it, including some of the most popular products of the past two years, and Comcast / SpinCo's business goals here were largely in aligning positively with these creatives. Many of these creatives would like _and were expecting_ to see a conclusion where all parties are left better off, such to avoid feeling negatively about the situation they participated in at Comcast / SpinCo's behest. This would be best for Comcast / SpinCo as a media company with future interests in working with creatives of all kinds in contracts of mutual benefit.

Furthermore, in the future exposure of this event could be to political or economic advantage to numerous parties, companies, and labor unions, so a conclusion that can be publicly claimed and agreed to by all parties involved, including myself, is the best course for the future should any conversation, public or private, arise.

Finally, it is my assumption that under your watch a certain amount of information must be gathered as to what happened, in both the near and long term. It is my guidance that those involved had very little to be proud of, and will all in different parts try and not tell a full story in order to be perceived in a better light than the truth. **Given this, I would strongly recommend seeking an outside investigator without any biases to Comcast / SpinCo or it's child organizations such to avoid issues of cognitive bias in seeking out all the details of what happened.**

All that said, I do wish to put this whole situation behind me, **as soon as possible**, and am more negotiable than not.

## A Pause to Explain Myself
#### 11/21/2024
#### _cc: all relevant parties at Comcast / SpinCo, NBC, et. al._

Look: I could be a little less direct in stating my case, it may in fact make things easier for all parties to settle on the damages that have occured to my person over this situation.

That said, I've only been manipulated and toyed with indirectly for nearly three years, so you can understand that I have no patience to wait for a conversation that hasn't actually started. Further or continued manipulations aren't helping - it may be a decent start to send everyone home and stop playing this game of stalking me in Montclair NJ, by the way.

So, please understand the second anyone is willing to talk directly towards settling this situation and ending it, I will stop my routine of making content around this situation. A direct conversation is all it will take. I'm beyond shocked this opportunity was not taken last week while my parents were out, as it would have been much easier than what we're doing now.

In summary: _without a direct conversation, I will continue to post my perspective, as it is the only direct conversation on this happening that I am afforded._

And, again, I do wish to put this whole situation behind me, **as soon as possible**, and am more negotiable than not towards settling the damages done to my person.

## A Plea for Objectivity
#### 11/25/2024
#### _cc: CEO Brian Roberts_

Mr. Roberts,

My family have been Comcast subscribers since we moved into this house in Montclair, back when your father ran the company.

I understand the majority of the revenue of Comcast is outside of it's media outlets, so in dealing with this situation, which mostly has been generated via it's media outlets, I'd ask you to consider seeking counsel outside of your company in guiding this situation forward, and ensure the counsel you seek is disconnected from Comcast's existing legal advisers as much as possible, including politically, given the upcoming shift in politics particularly.

It's unfortunate but given that so much of this involved manipulation on the edges of the law, and likely involved participation if not explicit guidance from Comcast's internal legal team, this means they will be unable to be objective when dealing with this situation.

It is often a rule for attorneys to not legally represent themselves in issues where they were involved directly, as personal bias will cause difficulty in making the right legal choices, causing emotional thinking to overrule rational thinking.

I fear that in this situation, the same is true for Comcast as a company: as your own legal team guided this project at different times, they will be unable to provide an objective look at what will be best _for the business_, and not just their own careers and connections.

Again, Mr. Roberts, please consider seeking outside counsel in learning how to end this situation in a way that would be best for Comcast as a _business_, and one that does a lot more than producing media. I still remember when we shifted our internet connection in this house to a Comcast cable line from another company's 56k connection around the time when you took over Comcast, I'd like for that to remain the only way I can speak to how your company expanded the bandwidth of my life.

## A Request for Normative Privacy
#### 11/26/2024
#### _cc: CEO Brian Roberts, Chairwoman Donna Langley, CEO Mark Lazarus (of Comcast, NBC Universal, and SpinCo respectively), and the rest of the boards at Comcast, NBC, and SpinCo_

My family's home is constantly under watch by a network of cameras owned by Comcast / NBC, intended for the purpose of a reality show around my person which I never signed to, and will never sign for. Furthermore, many of my devices are presumably using screen and webcam capture software for the same purpose.

There is no need to continue the recording of footage, the sharing of the footage via a live stream, or the employ of the numerous producers, vehicles, actors, and more temporarily stationed around my hometown of Montclair NJ hired to manage a reality show which will never happen.

Considering the mounting legal liabilities, I would hope the continuation of such things would not be seen as an advantage but a disadvantage to any necessary future defense of this situation.

Furthermore, to Mr. Lazarus specifically, I feel the live stream of the cameras is particularly hurtful to the efficacy and efficiency of two of the news networks you are taking over as SpinCo CEO, as well as hurtful to the bottom lines of the greater industry of live cable television to which you are a leader. For over a year now, network producers watch my movements throughout this home and coordinate with broadcasters to communicate and / or beguile me for purposes in competition with their own work products, and at times coordinate advertisements for the same purpose instead of for the bottom line. It's a waste of company money even if there were a product or strategic initiative available here, and there are not.

To Comcast / NBC at large, given that there is no viable product to be made here, and the legal disciplinary hearings which this may have been of some aid to is over, the continuation of this situation is at worst a potentially incriminating employ of company resources, at best a uniquely observable sunken cost.

Finally, though we are Indian and not Indigenous Americans, Thanksgiving is something my family intends to celebrate this Thursday with some of our extended family joining us. One of them is a minor. I'd appreciate if we could have this time in private as most families get to enjoy, as I am sure yours will, and I would appreciate that privacy extending past Thursday indefinitely, for the reasons stated above.

## A Riposte to Reality (Television Producers)

Hey Gang (note the above CC when I say "gang" to refer to those folks),

So, it looks like I'm still here and Comcast's board of directors is unable or unwilling to pull the plug, and if it's the latter, well, let's consider that from another angle.

Scott Fitzgerald is quoted as saying the following: 

> The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.

So, I know you don't _want_ to think about this but for the sake of an experiment in intelligent thought, please try.

Remember when you were younger, say the 1990s when you were in your 20s-40s? Remember when you were working your way up the ladder, looking up at those older folks in charge, hearing the stories and rumours about how, well, they were fucking up their whole careers, and many of their ranks and age knew, and almost everyone under their rank and younger than them knew, and no one was telling them?

Remember those times you told your older co worker or boss, whom you knew was sinking in a hole of their own creation, that you'd do some favor for them which you knew would only make the hole deeper, being kind to their face but snickering about suckering them behind their back?

Remember how when you were younger, you saw this stuff happen and got excited because it meant you have a shot to fill the void of leadership that would be created when the "shit hit the fan", so you did everything you could to let the "shit hit the fan" rather than help the people in charge avoid embarassment or career failure?

What if - and this is the opposing idea you might not want to entertain for the sake of this function you're playing in my life - _what if you were the ones fucking up and no one was telling you the truth_ beacuse it was better for them to let you fuck up so they could take charge, or in the case of the board of directors, not have to make a song and dance in front of the public shareholders when they remove you from your posts?

Like I said, it's no doubt a conflicting thought with the reasoning you're using to justify continuing this charade of criminality, but for the sake of intelligence, why not consider it?

I bet everyone else around you is.
